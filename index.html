       <li> If selected for this role, when can you be available to start?<br>
        -I would like to hear the role first. Once selected, I am available to start 2 weeks later. 
        <li>Can you briefly describe why you are looking for new opportunities at this time (layoff, contract end, career change, etc)?<br>
        - I am looking for a position where I can put my knowledge and skills to use in a more challenging way. 
        <li>The worksite is at Marshall Space Flight Center at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, AL. Is this a reasonable commute for you?<br>
        -It is a reasonable commute for me.
        <li>Unfortunately, no relocation assistance will be provided or negotiated for this role. If relocating applies to you, are you willing to relocate to Huntsville Alabama without assistance?<br>
        - I am currently within a reasonable commute so relocation is not needed at this moment.
        <li>This is a government contract, and full United States Citizenship is a NASA requirement. At the appropriate time, can you provide proof of U.S. Citizenship? (DO NOT send me any documentation, I just need to know you can provide upon hire).<br>
        -I am a U.S Citizen.
        <li>Please list any relevant earned IT Certifications (or if in-progress, please provide anticipated completion/certified date).<br>
        - I am currently pursuing the Comptia Security+ Certification.  Expected completion would be October 2021. 
        <li>Do you have a current and active DoD Secret Level (or higher) clearance? (not required for every position-only where stated). Alternatively, is there anything preventing you from obtaining one?<br>
            -Currently do not have any DoD clearances.  I have a clean record and can provide evidence if needed.
        <li>All of our positions are full-time, direct, and we offer a full benefit package. Do you have a preferred Salary range?<br>
            -I am open to a competitive salary based on the job description and duties.
